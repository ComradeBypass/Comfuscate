# Comfuscate
A 100% Python Obfuscator that uses bytecode!


## Documentation

- Comfuscate makes your python file really hard to read
- I dont recommend obfuscating files that were originally over 1mb

- You need to put your file in the same directory as the comfuscate file and open the comfuscate file, it will ask you for a file location, so for example: if my file was named "test" I would type test.py. After you type it, press enter. Commfuscate will start to obfuscate the file, it will create a completely new python file in the same directory that will be obfuscated.

## Requirements
- All the packages that are needed are already pre-installed in python.
- Its zlib, base64, codecs, random, os

## Obfuscated Code
